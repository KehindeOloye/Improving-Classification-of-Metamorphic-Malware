# Improving-Classification-of-Metamorphic-Malware

This is the dataset used in the work titled "Improving Classification of Metamorphic Malware by Augmenting Training Data with a Diverse Set of Evolved Mutant Samples", a work accepted for publication at the IEEE WORLD CONGRESS ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (WCCI) 2020 held between 19 - 24th July, 2020, at Glasgow (UK)). The dataset set comprises of 50 malicious mutant  variants  of  the malware  samples  collected  from  Contagio  Minidump and Malgenome as well as malicious samples from three differentfamilies,  namely  Dougalek,  GGtracker and  Droidkungfu. The samples were selected based on their  malicious  payload  and  they  fall  into  four  categories, namely those that either escalate privilege, try to gain remote control of phones, those that result in financial charges or those that steal personal information of users. Additional  malicious  samples collected  from  the  web are  also  from  the  Contagio  Minidump  which  consists  of families  such  as  Dougalek,  DroidKungfu  among  other  malicious  software.  The  benign  samples (50) on  the  other  hand, are  sourced  from  Google  play  store and  downloaded  using Apkdownloader. The benign samples are selected from various categories such as entertainment, gaming, communication among others. A  further  data-set of  malicious  mutants (50) is generated from 3 malware families.  A  final  dataset (30) consists  of  an  additional  generated  mutants  and  is  held  out  as  an  unseen  set  for testing. This dataset only contains mutants from those malware families present in the dataset collected from the web.

The dataset contains of both non-sequential and sequential data. While the sequential data comprise of a fixed sized vector with each element corresponding to the observed frequency of a potential system-call employed, sequential  data on the other hand, consists  of  the  time-ordered  list  of  system-calls. For the sequential data, we consider 251 system calls each with a numerical datatype. For each of the files, each row is a malware instance, and each column is a feature.
